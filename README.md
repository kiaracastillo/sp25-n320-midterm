**About project**

- Create a simple web server using Node.js
- Create and utilize frontend modules
- allow frontend modules to utilize specific node_modules

#### personal notes

- My code is incomplete. I'm stuck trying to add the products to the cart.
- I felt like I was running out of time, and I just panicked and forgot how to create the server from the beginning.
- I would appreciate it if you could give me recommendations for websites where I could practice more.
